# <Horiseon-refactor>

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to apply semantic html elements to refactor   the code to accessibility standards.
 
-The code was written correctly it was just not organized the right way and could be consolidated.
 
-One of the biggest issues that I found was the excessive use of div tags where semantic html elements could be used.

-In the end we made it easier to read the websites code making it easier to navigate through using semantic html elements.

## Credits

I think the biggest resource for me was google, using it to look up semantic html best practices and what elements should replace others.
